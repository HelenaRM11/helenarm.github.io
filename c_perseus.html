                    Perseus is a middle-aged man with salt-and-pepper hair. He is very tall, with a long nose and lovely hazel eyes. He has a neatly trimmed bear that Oziel loved to compliment him for and that could be called his pride and joy.<br><br>
                    Perseus is often dressed in blue jeans and a suede vest over a colorful shirt. He always wears a funky bow tie, which he readjusts when he’s nervous. Also, when Perseus is working at the Inn, he has a nametag pinned to his vest.

                    Perseus grew up in a neighboring town and he always admired Altar Cove’s town spirit. That is why, when he was in his late twenties, he decided to open up an inn in town. He thought that it would help with the tourist flow as well as serve as a calling for people looking for a city break.<br><br>
                    However, opening up the Salem Inn proved to be much more difficult than he had expected. Thankfully, Oziel took pity on him and decided to help him put together everything he needed. The many late night pouring over documents turned into a budding romance between the two of them, and the day after the opening party, Perseus finally gathered the courage to ask Oziel out. A few years later, Oziel proposed and they got married in the Town Hall with the full town in attendance. It was beautiful.<br><br>
                    Perseus and Oziel are incredibly happy together, and Perseus loves to bring treats for Aline and her sisters to thank them for everything they do for his husband.

                    Perseus is a very mild-mannered man. He offers a very calming presence both for nervous travellers and the chaotic energy of his husband, Oziel. He is always ready to offer a smile to his Inn‘s guests, but outside of the Inn he is serious and can even look imposing without meaning to.

                    Perseus is a very serious man, and he does go out of his way to talk to strangers outside of his work. This means that it will be a bit hard for the player to engage him in conversation outside of the Inn. However, if they catch him at the Town Hall or the Altar Cove Café, Perseus will be a bit more comfortable and will be willing to chat.

                    Perseus has a very calming aura, and he attracts visitors to the town. Sometimes, Perseus will host especial events and ask the player for help in hosting and organizing them.
