                    Nona is the ghost of a woman in her mid-forties who haunts the memorial to those fallen during the Witch Hunts around the world. She wears a simple, long-sleeved, brown dress with a white apron tied around her waist. Under a white scarf, you can see her salt-and-pepper long hair. Additionally, she still wears a noose around her neck, with the rope dragging cheerfully behind her.<br><br>
                    When she walks, None does not touch the floor, but gently hovers over it. She is also a little bit see-through. Although her coloring is more or less clear, she looks like she lost her brightness/contrasts.

                    Nona was one of the witches executed during the witch trials that took place near Altar Cove. She was accused by her own son, who didn’t want her to influence his new wife. She is one of the few true witches that fell victim to the trials in her town, and her spirit decided to stay nearby in order to help the other victims find their way to the Other Side.<br><br>
                    When the trials and executions were over, Nona found herself still tied to the mortal plane. Unable to cross over, she haunted the forest advising kind travelers and the witches that came to her with questions. Nona was the one who guided the town founders to where they could build the Town Hall. Moved by her kindness, the founders erected the Memorial, for the witches fallen in the trials. Because of this, Nona decided to stay around the Memorial and she’s still there today, offering advice to all that want to learn the practice of witchcraft.<br><br>
                    In recent years, Amina, the witch that manages the Altar Cove Library, has been slowly expanding the Memorial to include information on the trials and the lives of the witches from other regions and countries. As the Memorial grows, Nona is slowly growing stronger, and she occasionally can act as a tourist guide for those that visit the place.

                    Nona‘s personality has changed over the years. When she was alive, she was a practical and straightfoward woman who offered cures and remedies to the rest of the town. A widow and delicate mother, she always had a smile or a warm word for her family.<br><br>
                    However, after her execution, she heavily retracted into herself. The only people who she showed her warm side to were the other victims of the witch trials.<br><br>
                    Over the years as she haunted the forest, Nona carefully observed those who looked for her before showing herself to them. By that time, she had softened once more, but the grief and rage over her execution were still clearly present within herself. When those feelings took over, the forest became a a dangerous place for anyone who wouldn‘t respect nature or their elders.<br><br>
                    After the founding of Altar Cove, however, Nona finally appeared to find peace. In the years since the building of the Memorial, she slowly went back to the warm and practical disposition of her living days. She loves to help the townsfolk that practice whitchcraft and is always happy to teach new rituals to whoever asks. Amina is her favorite witch, because she visits her every day and especially takes care of the altar that the town built for Nona.

                    Even though Nona has regained most of her strength over the years thanks to the Memorial and her altar, she is still a ghost which makes it impossible for her to pick up objects.

                    Nona can make certain objects float and manipulate them, but always without physically touching them. Because she is a ghost, she can pass through characters, objects and walls, although she avoids passing through the altars out of respect.<br><br>
                    Nona will be a great help to the player, offering counsel and some materials as the game progresses. She gives instructions for a lot of the rituals used in the game and can give advice on general witchcraft to the player. Moreover, she can tell the player about the witch hunts and trials around the world, as they unlock this information throughout the game.
