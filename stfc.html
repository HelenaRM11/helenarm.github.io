                Star Trek: Fleet Command is a AAA top grossing 4x videogame. <br><br>
                In STFC you would explore through the galaxy to gain resources to improve your fleet and base. With a big social elements the game, was heavily sustained by its tightknit ingame alliances.  <br><br>

                <h1>More Info</h1>
                <p> In STFC I was part of the Content and Features Team where I contributed to several Tentpoles. <br><br>My main contribution were centered around my analysis of the game's core combat dynamics and how they worked in-game, creating onboarding documents for newcomers to adapt to a very intricate system.</p>
                <h2>Responsabilities</h2>
                <p>     
                • Designed and Balanced the Strike Team PvP Crew, contributing to a 3 part initiative centered around shifting the PvP Space in the game.<br><br>
                    • Designed and Balanced the Deep Space 9 PvE Crew<br><br>
                    • Designed and Balanced the initially released Active Ship Abilities, part of the Armory Building Feature<br><br>

                <h1>Strike Team PvP Crew</h1>     
                <p>As part of the Strike Team tentpole, I was tasked with designing and balancing a Trio of characters that would have to fit into the Battleship scheme inside the game.<br>As part of the task, this team had to become the strongest Battleship Crew out there, but it also had to respect the Combat Triangle inside the game, loosing to the Intreceptor scheme.<br>
                This was an arduous task, as technology was very limited, and some stats were already power crept to the maximum of their abilities inside the game. For example there was a character that already provided 100% Critical Strike chance to the crew without any conditions.<br><br>
                This task was acomplished using propietary tooling and Excel Sheets.</p>

                <h1>Deep Space 9 PvE Crew</h1>
                <p>As part of the DS9 Tentpole, and as I had notified Star Trek of my departure already, I was tasked with OnBoarding a fellow designer into what it took to do character design. <br> During this task we focused our efforts on making the next big crew to face Solo Armadas, without affecting Group Armadas or regular PvE. There is not much to note about this task, as Solo Armadas had been recently released and achieveing the power creep threshold was not a challenge. <br><br>

                <h1>Armory Building Feature</h1>     
                <p>As part of the tentpole, I was tasked together with another designer to create a new building: the Armory. It would allow you to unlock Active Ship Abilities for most ships in the game. These abilities were free of use, unlike other abilities in the game. <br>
                    My task in this feature was to create the list of ships that would benefit from these abilities, propose what these abilities would do, create them and balance them.<br>
                    During this process I had the pleasure of collaborating with other departments such as UI, UX, Programming and Product, which was not the case when you were working on content.<br><br>
