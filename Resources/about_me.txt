Dear recruiter,

My time in the industry as a professional isn’t the longest, only being able to involve myself as a professional in Omnidrone as a Game Designer. Despite that, I have developed 3 PC games during my time studying, one of which has been published on Console Systems, which I hope to leverage. My biggest strengths are game and level design, but I can also bring experience in programming, which I have honed through past projects.
I would love to have the opportunity to further discuss my skills with you and tell you why I think I’m a perfect fit for this position. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at the above email or phone.

I look forward to hearing from you.
Best regards,
