                    Alex is a young girl in her early twenties. She has dark, almond-shaped eyes and tan skin. Her hair is gathered into two French braids that go down to her waist and have colorful threads waved into them. She is wearing a slightly-faded band t-shirt, with a logo you can barely distinguish at the back. She also wears black jeans and brown mountain boots.<br><br>
                    Alex is small and stocky because of her extensive training as a gymnast. She is strong but she does not always look it. Her muscles are disguised slightly by her small stature. She also has a very warm, shy smile in her memories, although we never see her face outside of flashbacks or mirror glances.<br><br>

                    Alex is an only child, and her parents are very career-oriented. This meant that for the first years of her life, they were constantly moving around the country chasing new opportunities for her parents. Her family only stopped moving after she was 7, once her parents settled down in their careers.<br><br>
                    Thus, Alex moved to town when she was 7 years old, and it took a while to make friends. She was scared they were going to move again soon, so she didn’t really want to try. However, Julia was quick to insert herself into her space and pursue her, so they soon became best friends. They have been inseparable ever since.<br><br>
                    Alex trained in gymnastics since she was 3 years old, which was the only constant for her throughout all of her family’s moving around the country. When she was older, Alex was in her high school’s gymnastics team and she won a handful of meets and competitions over the years. She was very creative in her floor routines and always willing to try out new things in competitions. Julia used to help her with her music choices for important competitions. She stopped training after she started university, as she wanted to try other hobbies and she is still looking for that creative thing that can be considered her favorite.<br><br>
                    Alex’s parents got her a dog when she turned 4 so that she would always have a friend. She named him Mousse and was very dedicated to taking care of him. She taught him all kinds of tricks and even considered signing him up for those dog agility competitions. Mousse however, was not very enticed by that, as he just wanted to play with Alex and get treats. He died when Alex was 15, and it was a very hard blow for her.<br><br>
                    Alex and Julia applied for all the same universities, as they wanted to stay together through their college years. They luckily matched together for a good university and are sharing a dorm room at the student hall. Alex is still deciding whether she wants to study more History or Anthropology for her degree or major, but she is enjoying her classes.<br><br>
                    At the beginning of the game, Alex and Julia are heading to a music festival in her car. They were happily singing along to their playlist when a car popped a tire in front of them, and suddenly their car flipped over.

                    Alex was a very shy girl growing up. Her family moved around a lot when she was small, so it was hard for her to make friends. Julia, her best friend, became the person that helped her get out of her shell, and Alex let herself be encouraged to try new things and meet new people. She loves to learn new things, from new hobbies and skills to trying out new music or books.<br><br>
                    In all her timidness, Alex was also a very determined person, which showed in her schoolwork and her gymnastic skills. Throughout her years as a gymnast, Alex gained a reputation for being one of the bravest people on her team. She would often be the first person to try out new sequences or jumps, and experiment with the music for her floor routines. She also never failed to get up and try again when she fell or missed a step sometimes.<br><br>
                    Her relationship with her dog, Mousse, also makes it obvious that Alex is a very loving and kind person. She loved Mousse deeply and took care of him completely with no help from her parents. She would take him on runs and park visits, as well as teach him tricks so he could make other people smile when they were having a bad day. Mousse went everywhere with her and Alex struggled a lot when he passed away.<br><br>
                    Julia taught Alex how to be resourceful and make problem-solving decisions with what is available to her at the time. She is very good at using what is in front of her, but sometimes she can be too trustful or naïve.

                    Alex is terrified of bugs. When faced with any kind of insect, she will freeze for at least a few seconds, and she has never confronted or dealt with them before. She either calls for someone else to get rid of the bug (without killing them though), or avoids them as much as she possibly can, often walking around them at a safe distance.

                    Alex’s main abilities are her agility and acrobatics. Her gymnastics training is apparent in the way she moves, and she has fantastic balance because of practicing for the high beam. She is also very strong in her shoulders.
