                    Aline is a young witch with her blond hair gathered in pigtails. She has green eyes, and a very small nose. She is pale, which makes it very apparent when she blushes.
                    Her favorite color is pink, and she shows it off with pride. She wears a pink-and-white checkered dress accentuated by a big white bow at her waist. She also wears a white apron that is permanently stained by ink or colored wax. On her head she wears a small witch hat that matches her dress. To top it all off, there is often a small vase with seasonal flowers on her desk at the Town Hall.

                    Aline Works at the reception desk in Altar Cove’s Town Hall along with her sisters. She grew up in a nearby town, visiting Altar Cove’s Memorial almost every weekend with her aunt. Her aunt also was the one who introduced her and her sisters to witchcraft. Even though each of them has especialized in something different, Aline never found a particular practice that she was passionate about and she maintained her general education. That’s why she knows a little bit about everything.<br><br>
                    When all of the sisters were of age, they decided to move to Altar Cove together and slowly they each found their place in the community. Because of her people skills and love of organization, Aline quickly found a job as the receptionist for the Town Hall and assistant to the mayor, where she still works today. Amongst her main duties, is that of receiving any new neighbors to the town and to offer administrative support from the Town Hall.<br><br>
                    Every Sunday she visits the altar that she and her sisters built for her aunt when she passed. The altar can be found in a corner at the Memorial. Aline brings a new candle as an offering every week.

                    Aline is a cheerful girl, and she always has a smile ready for visitors. She loves to make up nicknames for all of her friends, which quickly includes the player. She has the patience of a saint to help anyone that has doubts about the Town Hall or wants to talk to one of her sisters. Also, she is extremely organized, which makes things much easier for Oziel, the café owner and mayor.<br><br>
                    She is the youngest out of the five sisters, and when she was younger she was pretty shy. But with Aroa and Anna’s help, she slowly came out of her shell. Aline is the only one who did not specialize in any particular practice because her real passion is traditional witchcraft and altar care. She often makes flower and special object offerings at the scattered altars in the Memorial space. Also, if the player talks to her while on a walk, they’ll probably receive some kind of crystal or will be able to consult the properties of the offerings they carry.

                    Aline can be naive and gullible, which means that she is fooled easily by some newcomers. If not for the fact that Altar Cove is a very nice, quiet town, Aline would have been in trouble multiple times over the years. But of course, the fact that she lives in a such a nice-mannered town, does not help her naiveté. This creates a bit of a ‘what came first, the chicken or the egg?’ situation. Is Aline naïve because she was born like that, or because the town made her like that?

                    Aline allows the player access to the rest of the reception witches at the Town Hall, who sell ingredients, potions, and postcards, process the adoption of familiars and allow the player access to their friend groups. If found outside of the Town Hall, Aline also offers advice on altar management and offerings, and can tell the player about the properties of any crystals, flowers or candles they are carrying.
