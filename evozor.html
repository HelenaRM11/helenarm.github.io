                <h1>Synopsis</h1> 
                <p>
                Evozor was a concept of a game destined to be a Character Collector MOBA game for phone.<br><br>
                In EVOZOR you would play 3 v 3 matches where you had to cooperate with your team to defeat corrupted creatures to gain their crystals.<br><br>
                Each game would be 2:30 minutes long and by the 2 minute mark a BOSS would spawn in, giving more crytals than any other monster.

                <h1>Game Economy</h1>     
                <p>We pursued an approach that allowed us to have multiple currencies, each focused on a different aspect of the game. Focusing on the softcurrencies, first we found the coins, which were earned after each game. These allowed you to buy objects and boosts in the Shop.<br>Then we found the Trophies, these were the competitive currency that allowed you to climb through the ranks of the game.<br>Lastly we found the Cristals, these were also earned after each game, and were directly related to the amount of cristals your team won ingame.</p>

            <div class="about-col">   
                <p>On the other hand we found the hardcurrency, this one allowed you to buy exclusive loot in the Shop. As the game was aimed to be played by a very young audience, we moved away from lootboxes.<br><br>Amongst the items we could buy with this currency we could've found the Premium BattlePass, Skins, Chromes, Icons, Taunts, Poses, Progression Boosters and Bundles.<br> With softcurrency, on the other hand, we could only buy Chromes, Poses, Icons and Taunts.    </p>

                <h1>Main Game Mode</h1>     
                <p>3 v 3 matches where your objective is to earn as many cristals as possible. These cristals are obtained by killing hostile NPCs around the map, corrupted Evozors. Whoever deals the fatal blow onto the corrupted Evozor, gains the cristals. <br><br> Killing your enemy forces them to spend some time dead, and sends them back to their base.

                <p> Each match lasts 2:30 minutes, and after 2 minutes have gone by, corrupt Evozor spawn is toggled off, and a Boss spawns in the middle of the map. <br><br>
                    This Boss gives more crytal than any other Evozor, and its meant to be a breaking point and climax of the game, that has the ability to tip the scales for any team if the other doesn't coordinate correctly for the event.

                <p>Characters had 6 stats, life, attack, armour, stamina, regeneration and speed. Each defining one key aspect of our combat.
                <br>As I started balancing the characters, I noticed that Regeneration was really hard to balance if it was a constant effect, so we decided to cap it out, only being active when you're not being attacked. <br> <br>

                <p> Each character had a Role that was maintained across their 3 evolutions. These Roles could be Bruiser Tank, Control Tank, Assassin, Long Range Damager, Support. <br><br>
                    These roles were reflected on the distribution of their stats and Character Abilities. <br><br>
                    Each character had 2 abilities, a Basic and an Ultimate. The Basic had a fixed cooldown, while the Ult was charged by dealing damage to enemies.

                <h1>Progression</h1>     
                <p>All player progression was based off the amount of cristals gained after each game. With these you would advance through the levels, adquiring new characters.
                <br>Each character on itself would also have its level, which would be increased by the same cristals. Across the levels we will adquire gear for each character as well as the materials necesary to evolve said character.

                <p> All of these stats we've talked about are complied in a Excel sheet, that I made during the development of the game. <br>
                    On this sheet we can find individual character stats, how the stats progress through the levels, how much cristals it takes to level up, battle pass progression and ability sets for each character.
