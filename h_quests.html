                <p>
                    This is a combat and exploration third-person game with an urban fantasy setting. Aspyn, a werewolf who is a professional fighter, goes looking for her cousin, Roland. <br><br>
                    Roland has gone missing in mysterious circumstances and Aspyn will have to go around the city winning fights and sorting or avoiding the conflicts of the two local, rival street gangs.

                    This Quest happens in an illegal fighting club. There are people cheering, booing, and betting on the fighters. Aspyn does not feel uncomfortable in a place like this, and the exploration is calm. But the combat requires a slightly frenetic rhythm, where the player feels the threat of the other fighter.

                    The game, provisionally named Altar Cove, is a life simulator role-playing game. This is a game where the player finds themselves turned into an animal hybrid because of a potion accident. <br><br>
                    The player has no previous experience with withccraft, but because of this incident he moves to a town full of witches and wizards. Slowly, the player will learn to use more and more magic until they are able to reverse the accident that made them into a hybrid.

                    This is the first quest of the game and serves as a presentation. After a short introduction of the town and the townsfolk, Aline guides the player to talk to Nona, the local ghost, in hopes that she’ll be able to point them towards the first steps in their mission.<br><br>
                    This way, the player can lightly explore the town and the different stages while he searches for the Memorial, which Nona usually haunts.
