                    This is a combat and exploration third-person game with an urban fantasy setting. Aspyn, a werewolf who is a professional fighter, goes looking for her cousin, Roland. <br><br>
                    Roland has gone missing in mysterious circumstances and Aspyn will have to go around the city winning fights and sorting or avoiding the conflicts of the two local, rival street gangs.

                    This Quest happens in an illegal fighting club. There are people cheering, booing, and betting on the fighters. Aspyn does not feel uncomfortable in a place like this, and the exploration is calm. But the combat requires a slightly frenetic rhythm, where the player feels the threat of the other fighter.
