                    Oziel is a short, middle-aged man with dark blond hair who always carries a wooden cane with him. He does not limp or seem to need it for any practical reasons, but he still carries it around. Sometimes you can find him carving symbols into it too. He has big dark eyes and a kind smile that give him the appearance of being gullible. He also wears round-framed glasses, although sometimes he will put them on top of his head and forget they are there.<br><br>
                    He has a lovely collection of sweaters that he wears on top of his regular suit pants and brown loafers. His sweaters are sometimes festive, sometimes plain, but they always add a small splash of color to his outfit. When he is out in his capacity as mayor, he will also put on a suit jacket, but he does not particularly enjoy those times because he does not like the jackets at all. They cover his lovely sweaters.

                <p>
                    Oziel was born and raised in Altar Cove. He was part of a long lineage of witches and descended from the town founders. He practiced witchcraft with his parents when he was younger, but eventually he realized he didn’t have the organizational skills to keep up with the craft and the wiccan calendar. After that, he relaxed his practice and leaned more into making offerings whenever he could.<br><br>
                    When Oziel was young, he learned to carve wood from his grandfather, and started making figurines. In his 20s, he often put up a stand where he sold his figurines at festivals and fairs. Now he just carves them as presents and personal offerings, although he will also carve some for whoever asks nicely.<br><br>
                    Oziel became the mayor of Altar Cove at a fairly young age, and one of the first changes that he implemented was that he started encouraging the town to teach tourists more about the experiences of witches and the history of the witch trials around the world. He was, and is, always encouraging mingling and unity amongst the villagers. His kind and loving nature quickly made him very popular with the townies, and he has kept his post as mayor since.<br><br>
                    A few years into his mayorship, a man moved to town with the intention to open an inn where tourists could stay. This man, Perseus, ran into all sorts of trouble with the permits and documents required to open his establishment. Oziel was eager to help him succeed though, which led to many late nights pouring over the documentation they needed and eventually a budding romance between the two men. They started dating the day after the opening party for the Salem Inn, and they got married a few years after.<br><br>
                    When Aline and her sisters moved to town, Oziel welcomed them eagerly and was overjoyed when they all found their place in Altar Cove. Aline has been a huge help for Oziel’s organization and has made him a much more efficient mayor, which is already impressive. Since she began working in the Town Hall, Oziel found himself with much more free time (now that he didn’t have to spend all his time looking for and re-arranging documents). This is when he decided to open the Altar Cove Café in the basement of the Town Hall. The café is a fairly recent addition to the town, but it is already very popular.

                        Oziel is a very kind and loving man, who is always willing to help out the neighbors in his town. He is always making wooden figurines to leave as offerings or for the people in town to use in rituals and spells. He has an air of gullibility that strangers often try to take advantage of, but the truth is that Oziel is a very smart businessman and very hard to trick. He opened the café in town because he was passionate about giving everyone a place to gather and have good coffee.<br><br>
                        On the other hand, he is often distracted. He tends to forget where his glasses are, and his paperwork is always disorganized. Aline has been a huge help in that regard, and since she started working at city hall, things have been running a lot more smoothly.

                    Oziel can be very distracted and disorganized, which means he will often ask the player to help him locate things, like his glasses. As a reward, Oziel always offers a recently carved wooden figurine. The friendliest the player is, the more rewards he will receive over time.
