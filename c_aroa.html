                    Aroa manages the familiar shelter that the player can access through the reception desk at the Town Hall. She is a bright, young witch that always has a smile on her face.<br><br>
                    Her dirty blond hair is pulled back by a pastel yellow bandana that compliments the open shirt she wears on top of her jean overalls. There is a name tag hanging from her shirt too. Her undershirt is white, but it has a smudged paw print on one side. Also, there is a small ferret peaking out of her chest pocket.

                    Aroa works at the familiar shelter in town and she also runs the veterinary service. She is the witch to talk to if you want to adopt a familiar, or if yours got sick in any way. You can also buy all the necessary accessories or treats by talking to her at the Town Hall’s reception desk. She grew up in a neighboring town, and she would visit the Memorial in Altar Cove with her aunt almost every weekend. Her aunt was also the one that introduced her and her sisters to witchcraft. Aroa chose to specialize in animal care and relations, and she even studied veterinary science so that she could help the animals at the shelter more efficiently.<br><br>
                    She moved to Altar Cove with her sisters and quickly rebuilt the shelter from almost scratch. It had been years since anyone had taken care of the stray and abandoned animals around, but Aroa was determined to give them all a good home. As time went by, she became the town’s vet as well, and she even takes care of some of the forest animals when she can.<br><br>
                    Aroa makes feathered wreaths from the discarded feathers she finds in the shelter, and she often leaves the wreaths as offerings at the different altars scattered around the memorial. Her aunt’s altar always has one, which Aroa changes once per season.

                    Aroa is a woman with a very sunny disposition. She loves animals and therefore adores her job managing the familiar shelter of Altar Cove. She is always smiling and joking around, and most of the familiars often hang around her when they haven’t been adopted, like the ferret in her pocket. There is very little that will make her angry, but if you mess with her sisters or with the animals in her care, all bets are off.<br><br>
                    Aroa is the fourth out of five sisters. She was always outgoing as a child and used to drag Aline along every time she would hang out with her friends. She is best friends with Anna, the middle sister, and they often can be seen around town together.

                    Aroa can be very unserious and carefree. She is so in love with the life that she leads that she sometimes forgets that others struggle or don’t enjoy their jobs. She is also very dedicated to the animals in the shelter, which means that they will always take priority over anyone (other than her sisters). Also, once or twice a month she gets so behind in her paperwork that she will be unreachable at the Town Hall’s reception desk.

                    Aroa can be accessed by talking to Aline at the reception desk in Altar Cove’s Town Hall. She offers the player the opportunity to adopt a familiar and buy accessories for them as well as veterinary care should the familiars need it. If found outside of the Town Hall, Aroa can be approached for a quick chat, but does not usually linger as she wants to get back to the shelter and her animals.
