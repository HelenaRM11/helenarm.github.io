                    Yaeko is an average-build woman of Japanese descendance. She always wears her long, black hair tied up in a high ponytail. Her eyes are dark, very serious but shiny. She has a small, diagonal scar on her cheek, right below her left eye. Yaeko does not smile often, but when she does, her face completely relaxes, and she loses the unfriendly expression most people know. Moreover, she has burn scars all over both of her arms.<br><br>
                    Yaeko wears traditional Japanese clothing consisting of a white shirt and a pastel orange hakama. She also wears tight, black espadrilles. She often has her Daishou, two Japanese swords of different sizes (one short, one long), hanging from her belt, and her Yumi, an asymmetric bow, slung around her back.<br><br>
                    She has a characteristic object, a colored-bead bracelet that belonged to one of her children.

                   Yaeko was the first-born daughter of a samurai clan specialized in air techniques. Her father was the clan chief, so she received a special education in the hops of finding her a suitable marriage.<br><br>
                    Yaeko learnt from a young age how to manage the state and the clan. Her father allowed her to observe the samurai’s training, although she was not allowed to participate. Her mother taught her, as well as the rest of the clan’s women, how to defend herself using spears and Yumi, in case they ever needed to protect their homes if the men were not around. Yaeko excelled in the use of weapons, and, in her room at night, she would mimic the movements she had observed the samurai practicing all day long.<br><br>
                    When she was 18 years old, she was married to the son of another air clan’s chief. In her new home, she was not allowed to observe the samurai’s training, but her brother-in-law taught her as much as he could during the nights. Her husband was kind, and eventually he joined them. Impressed by Yaeko’s abilities, the two brothers convinced their father to let her complete her training with the samurai. Thanks to her ability, her kindness, and her hard work, Yaeko earned the respect of the clan.<br><br>
                    When the chief died, Yaeko was named his successor. After becoming the new clan chief, she and her husband decided they would train men and women equally so that everyone would be safe. By then, the couple had already had a son, Haruto, and a daughter, Miyu, and they were expecting their third child.<br><br>
                    Unfortunately, a year after the birth of her third child, Yuuto, the clan was attacked. Yaeko was visiting her parents to attend her youngest sister’s wedding, so she was not there when the attack happened. When she got back, her house was on fire. She tried to rescue whomever she could, but no one had survived the attack. The only thing she found was an emblem that belonged to a samurai clan specialized on fire techniques.<br><br>
                    Over the next few years, Yaeko traveled around visiting other samurai clans and trying to convince them to help her pursue her family’s murderers. She trained with some clans specialized in wáter techniques, but no one agreed to help her get revenge.<br><br>
                    On her way to visit a clan specialized on earth techniques, a wealthy merchant hired her to protect his daughter, Haruko. Together, they embarked on a journey to Kurashiki, where Haruko is going to marry the son of another wealthy merchant. The young woman quickly became one of Yaeko’s closest friends. She reminds Yaeko of her daughter and the woman she might have become.<br><br>
                    When Haruko is kidnapped during an ambush, Yaeko will start her adventure to rescue her.

                    Yaeko is a serious and determined woman. She sticks to her training routines fervently. She is not particularly social, especially after the attack on her clan. However, she remains polite with everyone she meets along her travels, unless she is provoked.<br><br>
                    Because of the fact that she is a woman traveling alone, she has had some problems at inns and taverns with people that do not agree with her traveling and question her integrity and virtue. Luckily, Yaeko knows how to defend herself, and that has earned her certain renown amongst travelers. People bother her less and less now.<br><br>
                    She is always seen when she visits one of the other samurai clans, and she remains perfectly respectful, adhering to the customs and traditions she learnt when she was young. One of her great interests is to learn as many fighting styles as possible.<br><br>
                    She is not much of a talker; although usually reserved, children can always draw out a sad smile from her. Other women also can pull her into conversation, even though not easily. Haruka, the girl she is paid to protect, has become one of her closest friends partly thanks to her affable disposition and her youth. She reminds Yaejo of who her daughter could have grown up to be.<br><br>
                    Ultimately, she travels in the hopes of finding her clan’s murderers and getting revenge. But right now, she is pursuing Harulo’s captors to bring her back to her father, who, unbeknownst to Yaeko, was the person responsible for the deaths of her family.

                    Yaeko’s family was murdered by a band of ronin using fire techniques. Upon her return from visiting her parents’ clan, Yaeko finds her own wrapped in flames. When she saw the state burning, she run into the fire to try rescuing whomever she could, but by then everyone was dead, and she was hurt. The combination of the deep burns to her arms and her grief have left her with a paralyzing fear of fire.

                    Yaeko is a great hunter and tracker, which allows her to see signs of where her enemies have passed through in the case she finds herself at a fork in the road. She is a brilliant swordswoman, since she trains with her Daishou every morning and night, and a skillful archer. She can use her weapons with the air elemental effect in the beginning, and she will learn to use the water, earth, and void effects throughout the game.
