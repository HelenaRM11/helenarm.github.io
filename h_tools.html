            Narrative Design Element: Honey Stick

                <h1>
                    Visual Description
                </h1>     
                <p>
                    This is an average-sized, light-colored wooden Honey Stick. It can be personalized by adding colored ribbons and changing the tone of the wood as the player unlocks new levels.
                </p>
                
                <h2>
                    Who can use it? When?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Honey Stick can only be used by Moran. Between uses, at least 30 seconds must pass, unless this time can be shortened if the player upgrades it. To upgrade it, a player must talk to the fairies. The longer the player waits after the initial recharge, the further the Honey Stick can take them.
                </p>
                
                <h2>

                <p>
                    The Honey Stick does not cause damage. When you wave it, it opens a portal to another place.
                </p>

                    History
                </h1>     
                <p>
                    When Moran was only a bear cub, he was stealing food from some campers. He was trying to stick his head into a honey jar, when one of the humans carefully approached him and offered him the Honey Stick. Moran sniffed at it, curiously, and the human showed him how to use it, putting it inside the jar and pulling out the honey, which Moran happily licks up.<br><br>
                    After, Moran left the camp, with the Honey Stick between his teeth, but he got lost while he was looking for his mother. One of the forestâ€™s fairies saw him pass, lost and sad. In order to help Moran find his mother, and because she found the stick curious, the fairy conferred the Honey Stick with special powers.
                </p>

                    Penalties and limits.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Honey Stick cannot take you directly to the end of the level.
