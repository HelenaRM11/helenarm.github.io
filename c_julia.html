                    Julia only ever appears in flashbacks, although her voice accompanies the player and the main character, Alex, all throughout the game. She has a soothing and familiar voice; it should put the player at ease. <br><br>
                    Julia is a very tall young girl. She wears her hair short, so that she doesn't have to bother with it too much. ther eyes are a lovely honey-brown that matches the undertones in her hair. She also has a lot of moles and freckles everywhere: her face, neck, down her arms and on her chest.<br><br>
                    She often wears comfortable clothes over anything stylish, and she hates my clothing that restricts her movements in any way. Before the car accident at thee. beginning of the game, she was wearing an over- sized band t-shirt that was constantly falling off her shoulder and loose crochet shorts.

                    Julia grew up in the same town that Alex moved to when she was 7. She had a very normal, quiet childhood, except for the fact just she loved to get into mischief. Maybe it was just hiding her parents' keys, or the eraser for her classroom. Maybe it was taking home the classroom pet turtle, Mr. Shells, without telling anyone. Once she met Alex, she had someone to make her mischief more fun, because now she could share it. Also, no one ever believed that Alex would get into trouble, which always served them both as cover.<br><br> 
                    Julia started playing volleyball in middle school, when it became clear she was going to be tall. She, strangely, enjoyed the discipline and routine of the sport, so she continued playing through high school. She has also tried out for her university's team, but she hasn't heard back yet.<br><br>
                    In high school, she and Alex realized that they wanted to be together when they left, so they applied to all the same universities. Luckily, they managed to get acceptance letters from the same places, and they moved into their shared dorm in September. Julia was very excited. She is studying Biology, because after Mousse's death she decided she wanted to become a veterinarian.<br><br>
                    At the beginning of the game, Julia and Alex are heading to a music festival when they get into a car accident. Alex is hurt pretty badly, remaining unconscious and Kickstarting the game, but Julia isn't as banged up and she is calling for her friend. Julia will be the one to guide Alex (and the player) out of the messy archive that is her mind.

                    Julia is a very outgoing and cheerful person. She loves to talk to everyone and she was the first one to reach out to Alex when she moved to town. They become completely inseparable after that.<br><br>
                    Julia can be a bit blunt and forceful sometimes, but she's quick to make other people laugh so they don't hold it against her. She is a very direct person, who not only appreciates clear directions but always gives them too.

                    Because Julia is just see player's side, she does not really have a human aspect. Her voice is tethering Alex to the mortal plane, and so she often indicates where the player needs to go. She also will be the one to explain some of the game dynamics when they first appear.

                    In Apart's Levels, we followed the CCST Level Design framework, dividing every level into short challenges, surrounded by periods of relative safety. The challenges have to be coherent with eachother. In order to achieve that we evolve or expand the challenges. <br><br> When we expand a challenge, as the name suggests, we add new interactions of the same mechanic we were already seeing in that challenge.
