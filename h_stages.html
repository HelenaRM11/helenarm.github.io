                <p>
                    The Home where the player will be living throughout the game is highly customizable. During the game, the player will be able to modify not only the interior (furniture, floors and walls), but also the exterior (rood, door and mailbox). In the following paragraphs Home will be described in its initial appearance, before any possible personalization. <br><br>
                    
                    The Home is a 2-story building. It has a slanted roof with dark green tiles, and the exterior walls are painted in a slightly faded white. There are two square windows, one on each side of the door, and another arched window placed above the door on the first floor. The door is painted in the same dark green color as the roof, as is the mailbox next to it, but the paint is peeling.<br><br>
                    Inside, the house is distributed into three floors: the lower floor, the first floor, and the basement. Both the lower floor and the first floor are divided into two rooms, separated by arches on the wall. On the first floor, you can find a small living room, with two armchairs and a low coffee table, and a bedroom, with a double bed and a bureau. On the lower floor, you can find another common space, with a sofa, a rocking chair and a table, as well as an office, where there is an empty shelf and a desk. The basement is a big open space, with some shelves scattered around the walls.<br><br>
                    All around the house, the walls are papered with old green wallpaper. Additionally, the floors are all made of dark wood.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this stage, the main character/the player is the only character that appears regularly, although other townsfolk can appear to participate in certain rituals or assist the player with their potions.

                    This stage does not have any entry or exit requirements. It is always accesible to the player

                <p>
                   In this space, the player can use personalization and witchcraft game mechanics. All the furniture, wallpaper and floors can be easily changed if the player has the necessary objects. Moreover, the exterior can also be personalized by consulting the mailbox and paying the required game currency.<br><br>
                    In the basement, the player will set up their cauldron for all of their witchcraft practices. There they can carry out rituals, cast spells and prepare potions.

                <p> 
                    Home used to belong to Anton’s grandmother, who was the one who introduced him to witchcraft. She was a beloved member of the Altar Cove community, but she passed away a few years back. The Home has been empty ever since. Anton offers it to the player after the accident, and he gave them permission to modify it as they wish.<br><br>
                    The house was built by the grandmother herself, and she raised her family there. However, her children decided to move to the big city, and later Anton only visited for a few weeks during the summer.

                <p>
                    The Memorial was built in honor of the fallen witches during the witch trials around the world. It is a very discreet stone altar, with a low obelisk behind it. Tourists and descendants often come to leave offerings on the altar, which is why it is always covered in flowers, candles and photographs or drawings.<br><br>
                    It is situated on an expanse of terrain by the forest that borders the town of Altar Cove. Scattered around, there are small altars for the best-known witches, such as Nona, and different information stands that describe the history of various witch trials from different parts of the world.

                </p>

                <p>
                    In this stage you can always find Nona, who offers advice and teachings about witchcraft, or will recommend an appropriate candle or crystal. Every Sunday, Amina can also be found in the Memorial, usually talking to Nona, tending to the altars or guiding some of the tours for the visitors.<br><br>
                    Offerings can be made at the different altars, as well as check out the different objects placed at each of them. However, you cannot remove offerings that have already been placed.

                   In this stage the player can use the exploration and interaction game mechanics. The space can be easily explored, and offerings can be left at any of the altars. You can also consult the different information stands. There are several characters that hang around this stage, and the player can freely talk to all of them.

                    History
                </h2>
                <p> 
                    The Memorial was built shortly after the founding of the town, as a thank you to Nona, the local ghost, who guided the founders to the place where they could set up the Town Hall. It started out as a simple altar and was progressively expanded over the years to accommodate the growth and capacity of the town. They added the low obelisk behind the altar for the centennial of the town founding.<br><br>
                    Over the years, as the fallen witches’ descendant came to find Altar Cove, some smaller altars dedicated to the best-known witches popped up around the Memorial. Nowadays, Amina, the witch who manages the town’s Library, takes care of adding the information stands that describe the history of witch trials around the world. Moreover, Nona occasionally offers guided tours for the visitors that come to the town.
